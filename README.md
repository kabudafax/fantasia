# A new content incentive platform on Solana
- Solana integrated: Fantasia Creathon aims to leverage Solana’s high scalability, automation, and cost-efficiency. Drawing on Solana’s fully community-driven autonomous Web3 infrastructure and compatibility with the EVM system, we aspire to enhancing both the Fantasia and Solana ecosystems
- Integrated the EVM mechanism and ZK technology to ensure copyright ownership and originality verification of the collaborative projects, which also guarantees fairness.
## **Solana** **cNFT** Integrated

We could not have established such a thriving and collaborative creator community without the indispensable benefits brought by cNFTs on the Solana blockchain. Here are some of the key ways that cNFTs empower our Creathon:

1. **cNFTs substantially boost efficiency on Solana** - By combining multiple NFTs into one, cNFTs reduce transactions and congestion, enabling seamless collaborative creation between our diverse creators.
2. **cNFTs drastically lower costs** - Creators share gas fees when transacting using cNFTs, cutting the overall gas costs of our collaborative process tremendously. This makes participation far more accessible.
3. **Enhance asset liquidity in mass content co-creation scenarios** - much easier for creators with multiple low-value NFTs to engage in decentralized finance and trading within our community.
4. **Simplify management** - Creators don't have to manage each individual NFT separately, reducing operational complexity.
5. **Improved scalability** - They are more developer-friendly, allowing large-scale automated generation of NFTs representing our collective works.
6. **Boost security** - Their inherent structure makes them more resilient to potential attacks.

## **Synergy & Contribution** to Solana
1. Solana lacks projects in **the Passion Economy and creator economy spaces**, so Fantasia can **fill this gap** and provide unique value.
2. Fantasia will **bring diverse types of creators into the Solana ecosystem**, expanding and enriching the creator community.
3. Through **positive externality Tokenomic designs**, both internally and externally, Fantasia will enable creators, not just speculators, to earn real income and **move beyond the Ponzi model**. This aligns with Solana's goal of building real utility and value.
4. Fantasia Creathon will fully utilize Solana's **high performance, scalibility and** **AI capabilities** to seamlessly integrate our AI models, enabling smooth idea scoring and evaluation for collaborative creativity.
5. By focusing on niche passion communities, Fantasia will bring in **dedicated user bases that are deeply invested and engaged**, further increasing activity and transactions on Solana.
6. Fantasia's gamified and transparent approach will **showcase the strengths of blockchain for new user segments**, acting as an onboarding portal for mainstream consumers to experience the benefits of Solana firsthand.
7. As an innovative model for community-driven co-creation and crowdsourced storytelling, Fantasia will highlight new use cases that demonstrate Solana's versatility and ability to support next-gen applications.

# Description

## Content Incentive User Flow

### 1. Creator Creates a Space
Creators can establish a “space” on the platform based on specific themes or personal identities. Within this space, they can set up a revenue-sharing mechanism and deploy an on-chain treasury on the blockchain. By minting cNFTs (content NFTs), creators generate an identity for their space, with the treasury using this NFT as a marker for future revenue distribution.

#### Sources of Income:
- **Donation Revenue**: Supporters can directly contribute to creators through donations.
- **NFT Sales Revenue**: Creators can earn income by selling NFTs related to their creations.
- **Article Reprint Revenue**: Creators receive corresponding income when their articles are reprinted on other platforms.
- **IP Operation Revenue**: Creators can earn additional income through licensing their works.

### 2. Producing Quality Content
After launching their space, creators need to focus on producing quality articles to attract fans and members. Articles can be categorized as paid and non-paid. Users holding membership NFTs can read paid articles for free. Additionally, tips for individual articles will go directly to the creator's wallet address, further motivating them to create better content.

### 3. Readers Join Membership
Readers can choose to become members and enjoy membership privileges. Those holding membership NFTs not only get free access to paid articles but also share in the treasury's revenue distribution rights. This mechanism ensures that members benefit from supporting creators while receiving corresponding income from the creations.

### 4. Role of Speculators
Speculators act as lubricants in the entire ecosystem. Their goal is to identify potential high-quality authors early, purchase related NFTs, and anticipate appreciation in value. This behavior promotes the discovery of quality authors and provides more exposure opportunities for creators.

### 5. True Reflection of NFT Prices
The price of NFTs can more accurately reflect a creator's value compared to traditional "likes." Creators who consistently produce quality content can maintain high prices for their memberships, creating ongoing incentives for creation.

### 6. Treasury Revenue Sharing
The revenue-sharing mechanism of the treasury ensures the interests of member purchasers. Through reasonable revenue distribution, members can recoup their investments while incentivizing creators to continually enhance content quality, forming a virtuous cycle. This mechanism guarantees the healthy development of the ecosystem, attracting more creators and readers to participate.

Through these aspects of design, the content incentive mechanism not only provides creators with stable revenue streams but also enhances interaction and collaboration among users, promoting the thriving development of the entire ecosystem.

# Innovations

Fantasia is a creator-centric platform that leverages blockchain technology to address content motivation and engagement issues in the creative landscape. Its innovations include:

1. **Creator Empowerment**: Creators can establish personalized "spaces" based on specific topics or identities, allowing them to set their own revenue distribution mechanisms.

2. **On-chain Treasury System**: Each space features an on-chain treasury that collects various income streams, including donations, NFT sales, article reprints, and IP operations, ensuring transparent and fair revenue distribution.

3. **NFT-based Identification**: Creators can mint NFTs (cNFTs) as identity markers for their spaces, which also serve as indicators for future revenue distribution.

4. **Membership and Engagement**: Readers can become members by holding membership NFTs, granting them access to exclusive content and a share in treasury revenues. This dual benefit incentivizes reader participation and loyalty.

5. **Realistic Value Representation**: The NFT pricing mechanism reflects more genuine support than traditional "likes," promoting long-term content quality and sustainable creator income.

6. **Community-driven Ecosystem**: By involving speculators who seek promising creators, Fantasia fosters an environment where high-quality content is discovered and valued, countering the influx of toxic users seen in other platforms.

7. **Enhanced Interaction**: Unlike traditional platforms, Fantasia emphasizes ongoing interaction beyond initial content consumption, recognizing that meaningful discussions can enhance the value of creative works.

8. **Public Goods Clarification**: Fantasia addresses the notion of public goods by clearly defining ownership and rights within its ecosystem, establishing a binding interest community that supports long-term, organic growth.

Overall, Fantasia aims to create a sustainable and interactive content ecosystem that rewards creators and engages readers through innovative blockchain applications.
